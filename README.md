# ideas

A growling list of project ideas I have in my mind

- [ ] A CLI tool for instant file search, inspired by [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/)

- [ ] A neural net implemented from scratch, in C ([KnowYourCharacter](https://github.com/lalitshankarchowdhury/KnowYourCharacter))

- [ ] An in-memory key value store, implemented from scratch, in C like [Redis](https://redis.io/)
